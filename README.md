# üéÆ Controller Mapper JUCE Application

A JUCE-based MIDI controller mapping tool for PlayStation controllers.

## üìã Overview

This application detects gamepads connected to your PC and allows you to map PlayStation controller inputs to MIDI messages for use in your DAW. While support is currently to be limited to DualShock PS4 controllers, future versions may introduce dynamic detection and mapping for other devices.

## ‚ú® Projected Features

- üéÆ **Controller Detection**  
  Detects connected gamepads and verifies if the controller is supported (currently only DualShock PS4).

- üß† **Input Mapping to MIDI**  
  View real-time MIDI messages generated by controller input in a dedicated MIDI console.

- üéõÔ∏è **Custom GUI for Mapping**  
  Assign controller inputs to modulation parameters in your DAW through an intuitive graphical interface.

- üìÅ **Scene Management**  
  Create, save, and load different mapping "scenes" for different projects or workflows. Seamlessly switch between scenes live.

- üéöÔ∏è **DAW Transport Integration**  
  Includes MIDI controls for common DAW transport actions:
  - Play
  - Stop
  - Record
  - Zoom
  - Scroll
  - Engage Loop

## üîß Technologies Used

- [JUCE](https://juce.com/) ‚Äî Cross-platform C++ framework for audio and GUI applications  
- [SDL3](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL) ‚Äî Used for gamepad input handling  
- C++17 ‚Äî Main programming language

## üöÄ Getting Started

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This app currently only supports PlayStation DualShock 4 controllers. Other controllers will not be recognized.

### Prerequisites

- JUCE 7+
- C++17-compatible compiler
- SDL3 development libraries
- A DualShock PS4 controller

### Notes

In order for SDL3 to work, you need to add a copy of the executable to your build folder.
copy SDL3.dll from lib/SDL3/bin/SDL3.dll
and add to /Builds/VisualStudio2022/x64/Debug/

So I've thought harder about my usee case and whether or not JUCE is a good fit for my project. It seems like JUCE is a lot of unnecessary bulk.
I'm not processing audio or receiving MIDI, and I have to use 3rd party tools to receive controller input (SDL) and send midi output (midiLoop/rtmidi)
The main perk of JUCE at this point is gonna be the GUI Building. I'm gonna use the juce::Timer to poll messages, and I'll use their midi message object for creating midi messages. But man... I'vee put a lot of time into this, particularly learning JUCE stuff, and now it feels like I could accomplish my product without JUCE haha.
